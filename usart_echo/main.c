/* 

  USART echo test for the STM32L072  Project

  Configuration is 115200 8-N-1. Only "\n" is sent. Receiving terminal should add \r
  (e.g. use add CR function in "minicom")
  

  Linux:
    stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 sane 115200 && cat /dev/ttyUSB0
    or stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 sane 115200 igncr  && cat /dev/ttyUSB0
    screen /dev/ttyUSB0  115200 (terminate with "C-a k" or "C-a \")
    minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0  -b 115200 (terminate with "C-a x", change CR mode: "C-a u", disable HW control flow!)
    

  Ensure that -DUSER_VECT_TAB_ADDRESS is set during compilation, otherwise
  interrupts will not work after the "go" commant of the flashware USART upload.
  
  Problem is, that SCB->VTOR doesn't point to FLASH_BASE, so manually
  assigning SCB->VTOR = FLASH_BASE;	will also fix this.
